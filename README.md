# XO GAME

I made XO game using HTML, CSS, javaScript, and [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/), [JavaScript library for creating particles](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js), [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/), and [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

## Approach:

The main process is to compare the div id with the array values. If they are matched then the player name will save into the array. In addition, there is a counter for each player.
