# XO GAME

I made XO game using HTML, CSS, javaScript, (jQuery)[https://code.jquery.com/], (JavaScript library for creating particles)[https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js], and (animate.css)[https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/].

## Approach:

The main process is to compare the Id div with the 3D array values. If they are matched then the player name will save into the array. In addition, there is a counter for each player.
